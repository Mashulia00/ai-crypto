# ML signals for the crypto market: overview

The model classifies market **regimes** (trend / flat / high volatility) and returns probabilities  
Decisions on trades are made according to rules not emotions

## How we avoid overfitting
- Honest data split and cross validation
- Hard constraints stop losses take profits risk per trade
- Real time quality monitoring (demo)
