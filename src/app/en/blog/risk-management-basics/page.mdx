# Risk management: basic principles

**Discipline over emotions** Work with a predefined risk per trade (for example 05–1% of equity) 
a clear stop loss and position size limits

## What we control
- Risk per trade and daily loss limits
- **Max DD** of the portfolio — if the limit is exceeded we reduce exposure
- Accounting for commissions and slippage in tests
